Therefore,\n such ordinance made amendments to existing ordinances in Code to align with the City's\n gender-inclusive policies.\n\nIn the construction of the ordinances of the City of Madison the following rules shall\n be observed unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent\n of the ordinance.\n(1)\nGeneral Rule\n. All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common\n and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases and such others\n as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law shall be construed\n and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\n(2)\nGender-Inclusive Language\n.\n(a)\nMadison General Ordinances shall be drafted with gender-inclusive language consistent\n with Administrative Procedure Memoranda 2-52 and its attachments and resources.\n(b)\nThe words \"they\", \"them\", and \"their\" may be used as a singular pronoun to refer to\n one individual person. The singular \"they\" is grammatically correct.\n(c)\nThe Common Council authorizes the Office of the City Attorney to make the appropriate\n changes to the ordinances consistent with this section and to implement the codification\n of such changes without further action of the Council.\n(Am. by\nORD-22-00128\n, 12-15-22)\n(3)\nPerson\n. The word \"person\" shall extend and be applied to firms, corporations, or voluntary\n associations, as well as to individuals, unless plainly inapplicable.\n(4)\nTenses\n. The use of any verb in the present tense shall include the future when applicable.\n(5)\nShall Have Been\n. The words \"shall have been\" include past and future cases.\n(6)\nHeretofore and Hereafter\n. Whenever the word \"heretofore\" occurs in any ordinance it shall be construed to\n mean any time previous to the day when such ordinance shall take effect; and whenever\n the word \"hereafter\" occurs it shall be construed to mean the time after the ordinance\n containing such word shall take effect.\n(7)\nJoint Authority\n. All words purporting to give a joint authority to three or more City officers or\n other persons shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such officers\n or other persons unless it shall be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving\n the authority.\n(8)\nActs By Agents\n. When an ordinance requires an act to be done which may by law as well be done by\n an agent as by the principal such requisition shall be construed to include all such\n acts when done by an authorized agent. Wherever these ordinances direct or allow a\n public official to take action, that action may be taken by the official's designee.\n (Am. by ORD-09-00004, 1-24-09)\n(9)\nReasonable Time\n. In all cases where any ordinance shall require any act to be done in a reasonable\n time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or notice shall be deemed\n to mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance of such duty,\n or compliance with such notice.\n(10)\nTime - How Computed\n. The time within which an act is to be done as provided in any ordinance or in any\n order issued pursuant to any ordinance, when expressed in days, shall be computed\n by excluding the first day and including the last, except that if the last day be\n Sunday or a holiday it shall be excluded; and when any such time is expressed in hours\n the whole of the Sunday or the holiday, from midnight to midnight, shall be excluded.\n Except as otherwise specified in these ordinances, \"holiday\" means a statewide legal\n holiday as provided in Sec. 995.20, Wis. Stats., provided, however, that when an act\n is permitted to be done by the use of the postal service, and the last day within\n the time prescribed by law for performing such act falls on a legal public holiday\n under federal law, or other holiday designated by the president such that the postal\n service does not receive registered mail or make regular deliveries on that day, the\n day shall be considered a legal holiday for purposes of this section. (Am. by Ord.\n 11,278, 6-19-95; Am. by\nORD-23-00008\n, 1-12-23)\n(11)\nWeek\n. The word \"week\" shall be construed to mean seven days; but publication in a newspaper\n of any notice or other matter indicated to be for a stated number of weeks shall be\n construed to mean one insertion in each week, unless specifically stated to be for\n each day of the week or for more than one day in each week; and all publications heretofore\n made in accordance with the terms of this subsection are hereby validated.\n(12)\nFine\n. The term \"fine\" shall be the equivalent of the word \"forfeiture.\"\n(13)\nReferences to Wisconsin Statutes\n. A reference to the Wisconsin State Statutes shall be construed to mean the most\n recent version of cited statute. (Cr. by ORD-14-00165, 10/29/14)\n(14)\nSingular and Plural\n. Every word in any ordinance importing the singular number shall extend and be applied\n to several persons or things as well as to one person or thing; and every word importing\n the plural number shall extend and be applied to one person or thing as well as to\n several persons or things. (Cr. by\nORD-22-00128\n, 12-15-22)\n\nThe rules of construction set forth in this chapter shall not be applied to any ordinance\n which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the\n subject matter or context of such ordinance may be repugnant thereto.\n\nIn addition to the rules of construction specified in Section\n1.01\n, the following rules shall be observed in the construction of these ordinances:\n(1)\nAll references to titles, chapters, or sections are to the titles, chapters and sections\n of these ordinances unless otherwise specified.\n(2)\nIf the provisions of different chapters of these ordinances conflict with or contravene\n each other, the provisions of each chapter shall prevail as to all matters and questions\n growing out of the subject matter of such chapter.\n(3)\nIf conflicting provisions be found in different sections of the same chapter the provisions\n of the section which is last in numerical order shall prevail unless such construction\n be inconsistent with the meaning of such chapter.\n\nAll ordinances passed by the Common Council, except when otherwise specifically provided,\n shall take effect and be in force from and after their publication.\n\nWhen any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or provision, shall be itself\n repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive such former ordinance, clause\n or provision, unless it shall be expressly so provided.\n\n(1)\nIn any case where there shall be a violation of any City ordinance for which no penalty\n is provided, the person violating the same shall be subject to a forfeiture of not\n less than one dollar ($1.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each\n offense, except as provided in the following subsection.\n(2)\nIn any case where any ordinance or section of an ordinance of the City of Madison\n shall not provide the greater penalty for a second or subsequent conviction for a\n violation thereof any person violating the same who shall previously have been convicted\n of a violation thereof shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than ten dollars\n ($10) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200) for each offense, except that where\n the penalty provided by any such ordinance or section for a first violation thereof\n shall be larger than the penalty herein provided such larger penalty shall be applicable.\n(3)\nNo violation of any ordinance of the City of Madison shall be or be construed to be\n a misdemeanor nor shall imprisonment be imposed as a punishment for violation of any\n ordinance of the City of Madison except in the event of a failure of the defendant\n to pay the forfeiture imposed by the court, any other provision of the General Ordinances\n of the City of Madison to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWhen a forfeiture shall be imposed for the violation of any ordinance of the City\n of Madison or any section thereof the court may also sentence the defendant to pay\n the cost of the action and to be imprisoned until such forfeiture and costs are paid,\n in no case, however, to exceed six (6) months, and the court may also issue an execution\n against the property of the defendant for said forfeiture and costs.\n\n(1)\nPursuant to the authority of Sec. 66.0113 of the Wisconsin Statutes, the City of Madison\n hereby elects to use the citation method of enforcement of ordinances including those\n for which a statutory counterpart exists.

The Madison Police Department (MPD) has historically responded to all alarm activations\n within the City of Madison. The incidence of false alarms has increased on an annual\n basis and is expected to continue to increase as the City grows and the number of\n alarm installations grows with it. Today, the false alarm rate is approximately ninety-seven\n percent (97%). In 1983, in response to a false alarm rate of ninety-eight percent\n (98%), the Madison Common Council enacted Sec.\n5.08\n, MGO, with a provision to penalize businesses and residences for false alarm calls\n responded to by MPD. The ordinance established a graduated penalty structure based\n upon the number of false alarm calls in a twelve (12) month cycle. The MPD crime prevention\n office handles the compiling of data related to false alarms and the citation paperwork.\n The crime prevention office has had to dedicate increasing hours to handling false\n alarms. This increase has reduced the Crime Prevention Officer's ability to focus\n on the primary goals of the Crime Prevention Unit, which are outreach and education\n relative to personal safety and property security. The time spent responding to and\n searching locations where false alarms are activated may endanger the public by preventing,\n diverting or delaying police officers from patrolling a neighborhood, responding to\n calls for service, including bona fide emergencies, and investigating and solving\n crimes. Time spent responding to false alarms also reduces the amount of time officers\n can devote to important community policing efforts. Based upon these findings, the\n City of Madison Police Department will now respond to certain alarm devices only when\n the response has been verified as set forth in this Ordinance.\nThe purpose of this section is to establish standards and controls of the various\n types of emergency alarm signals from alarm devices or systems that require a police\n response. This section applies to any person, business, firm, corporation or any commercial\n entity owning, operating or maintaining any alarm devices or alarm systems designed\n to summon the police to any location in response to a signal or other transmission\n generated or produced by such devices.\n(2)\nDefinitions\n. For the purpose of this Ordinance, the following definitions shall apply:\n\"Alarm\" means any sound, signal or message generated by an alarm system, alarm user\n or other person, to which police personnel are expected to respond.\n\"Alarm user\" means the person, partnership, corporation or other entity of any kind\n in control of any building, structure or facility or portion thereof, wherein an alarm\n system is in operation.\n\"Alarm System\" means any system, device, or mechanism which, when activated, transmits\n a telephonic, wireless, electronic, video, or other form of message to an alarm system\n monitoring company, or some other number, or emits an audible or visible signal that\n can be heard or seen by persons outside the protected premises, or transmits a signal\n beyond the premises in some other fashion, except any system, device, or mechanism\n primarily protecting a motor vehicle or a medical alert alarm. An alarm system or\n alarm device may consist of one or more components (e.g. motion detector, window breach\n detector or similar components) all reporting to a central alarm station.\n\"Automatic dial device\" means any device that automatically sends over regular telephone\n lines, by direct connection, a prerecorded voice message or coded signal indicating\n the existence of some type of emergency to which police ", "url": "https://library.municode.com/wi/madison/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=COORMAWIVOICH1--10_CH5PODEPORE", "jurisdiction": "Madison, WI"}, {"section_number": "", "title": "Madison, WI", "chapter": "Loading, please waitMadison, Wisconsin - Code of OrdinancesCHAPTER 6 - FIRE DEPARTMENT AND FIRE REGULATIONS", "content": "Footnotes:\n--- (\n1\n) ---\nEditor's note\u2014\nORD-22-00128, published December 15, 2022, updated gender-inclusive language.

In the exercise of its police powers, the City has priority over all other uses\n of the public rights-of-way. The City desires to anticipate and minimize the number\n of obstructions and excavations taking place in the public rights-of-way to ensure\n that the rights-of-way remain available for public services and safe for public use,\n and to ensure that facilities are timely maintained, supported, protected or relocated\n to accommodate reconstruction or repairs. The taxpayers of the City bear the financial\n burden for the upkeep, maintenance and reconstruction of the rights-of-way and a primary\n cause for the early and excessive deterioration of the public rights-of-way is the\n frequent excavation by persons who place facilities therein.\nThe City finds that there has been an increase in the use of the public rights-of-way\n and, as a result, increased costs to the taxpayers of the City and that these costs\n are likely to continue into the foreseeable future.\nThe City finds that delays by occupants of the rights-of-ways in maintaining, supporting,\n protecting or relocating facilities, if they impact public construction projects,\n have the potential to significantly increase public works project costs borne by the\n taxpayers. Moreover, the City finds that some right-of-way occupants have a history\n of delays and nonresponsiveness.\nThe City finds that occupancy and excavation of its rights-of-way causes direct and\n indirect costs to be borne by the City and its taxpayers, including but not limited\n to:\n1.\nAdministrative costs associated with public right-of-way projects, such as registration,\n permitting, inspection and supervision, supplies and materials;\n2.\nManagement costs associated with ongoing management activities necessitated by public\n right-of-way users;\n3.\nRepair or restoration costs to the roadway associated with the actual excavation into\n the public right-of-way; and,\n4.\nDegradation costs defined as depreciation caused to the roadway in terms of decreased\n useful life, due to excavations into the public rights-of-way.\nIn response to the foregoing facts, and pursuant to its authority under Wis. Stat.\n \u00a7\u00a7 62.11(5), 86.16, 182.017, and 196.58, the City hereby enacts this ordinance relating\n to the administration of and permits to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public\n rights-of-way. This ordinance imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and\n maintenance of facilities currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein\n at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and\n federal agencies.\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to provide the City a legal framework within which\n to regulate and manage the public rights-of-way, and to provide for the recovery of\n costs incurred by the City in doing so. This ordinance provides for the health, safety\n and welfare of the residents of the City as they use the rights-of-way of the City,\n as well as to ensure the structural integrity of the public rights-of-way.\nUnder this section, all persons who excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public rights-of-way\n will reimburse the City's administrative, inspection, ongoing management and degradation\n costs. Right-of-way users will bear a fair share of the financial responsibility for\n the integrity of the public rights-of-way.\n(b)\nDefinitions\n.

Conveyances as aforesaid\n for the street and park purposes of the land in or opposite any of the aforesaid Blocks\n 14, 19 and 20, shall be deemed a compliance as to such block with the foregoing conditions\n and thereupon, as to such block, the dock line aforesaid shall become established.\n(4)\nWhereas the owners of the land opposite said Blocks 14 and 19 have heretofore completed\n the filling out to said dock line, such filling is hereby ratified, confirmed and\n approved upon the conditions named in subsection (3) hereof.\n(5)\nThe owners of property in said Block 20 are hereby authorized to fill out to said\n dock line to the same depth and upon the same grade or slope as the filling in said\n Blocks 14 and 19, on the conditions contained in subsection (3) hereof.\n(6)\nThe public streets crossed by said dock line, namely Erin, Emerald and Drake, shall\n be considered as extended as public streets out to said dock line, and the rights\n of the City in the portion of said streets so extended shall be the same as in other\n parts of said street.\n\n(1)\nA dock line is hereby established on the shore of Lake Monona as follows: Beginning\n at a point immediately below the center line of the main track of the Chicago, Milwaukee,\n St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company right-of-way, Prairie du Chien Division, distant\n 800 feet southeasterly from the northwest line of West Wilson Street extended, said\n 800 feet being measured along the center line of the above-mentioned track; thence\n by a curve to the left with a radius of 300 feet, the center of said curve being 500\n feet southeasterly from the northwest line of West Wilson Street and in the center\n of the above-mentioned track, turning a total angle of 40 degrees and 45 minutes;\n thence by a curve to the right with a radius of 1,800 feet, turning a total angle\n of 23 degrees; thence by a curve to the right with a radius of 400 feet, turning a\n total angle of 67 degrees and 30 minutes, to a point distant 591 feet southeast from\n the southeast line of West Wilson Street measured on a line 6 feet northeast of the\n southwest line of Bassett Street in said City of Madison.\n(2)\nThe City of Madison is hereby authorized to fill out from the present shoreline to\n said dock line sufficient depth for the purpose of removing the unsanitary and offensive\n condition of the bed of the lake between the said shoreline and said dock line, and\n for the purpose of aiding navigation of the waters of said lake.

(Am. by ORD-06-00091,\n 8-2-06)\n\n(1)\nDevelopment Impact Fee Zones are established as shown on the Development Impact Fee\n Zones Map. Such development impact fee zones will be established consistent with any\n facility service areas and public facility needs assessment for each public facility.\n(2)\nAdditional development impact fee zones or combinations of development impact fee\n zones may be designated by the Common Council consistent with the procedure set forth\n in this ordinance and with Wis. Stat. \u00a7 66.0617.\n\n(1)\nWest Elderberry Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement Impact Fee\n.\n(a)\nIn response to new and future Development demands in the Lower Badger Mill Creek watershed,\n in the area generally west of Schewe Road and Bear Claw Way, and east of Pioneer Road\n (extended north and south), and north of Mineral Point Road and south of Old Sauk\n Road, on the far west side of Madison, additional new public sanitary sewer facilities\n must be constructed to allow such Developments to proceed. Specifically, to adequately\n serve this new and future Development, the City must extend and construct new sanitary\n sewer interceptors. Therefore, the Common Council hereby establishes the West Elderberry\n Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement Impact Fee District as a mechanism to equitably\n charge all new Developments in this District their proportional share of the cost\n for necessary sanitary sewer improvements in the watershed.\nFor purposes of the Sanitary Sewer Improvement Impact Fee imposed under this section,\n the said District shall be all existing undeveloped land that currently drains or\n is altered to drain to the West Elderberry Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement\n drainage area, as more specifically described and identified as follows:\nAny and all undeveloped parcels (platted and/or metes and bounds), or portions thereof,\n located within, or that are altered or pumped to discharge sewer outflow within the\n West Elderberry Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement service area. These lands\n are located within the City of Madison and the Town of Middleton as follows: Parts\n of the NE \u00bc of Section 20, all of the SE \u00bc of Section 20, and parts of the SW \u00bc of\n Section 21, all within Town 7 North, Range 8 East, located in the Town of Middleton\n and the City of Madison.\nThe said District shall also be shown on the Development Impact Fee District Map.\n(b)\nCalculation of the Impact Fee\n. The amount of the West Elderberry Sanitary Sewer Improvement Impact Fee to be imposed\n on individual properties shall be calculated based on the amount of Net Developable\n Area of the land being developed within the above-described District. The subject\n Impact Fee is based upon the estimated Cost to construct the necessary public improvements.\n Prior to the recording of any certified survey map or any final Subdivision Plat,\n or the issuance of building permits following approval of a rezoning or conditional\n use permit, the City shall calculate the amount of net area being developed, based\n on the proposed certified survey map, final Subdivision Plat, or other applicable\n public records.\nIn the undeveloped areas of the West Elderberry Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement\n Impact Fee District, the Impact Fee shall be $109.26 per 1,000 square feet of Net\n Developed Area. In areas already developed without public sanitary sewer, the Impact\n Fee does not apply, but these parcels may be specially assessed or charged connection\n fees for sanitary sewer service at a rate of $109.26 per 1,000 square feet.\nThe said Impact Fee, special assessment, and connection fee rates are established\n in 2018 dollars and shall be indexed for inflation annually (January 1st) thereafter\n with June, 2018 as the base, using the Construction Cost Index as published by the\n Engineering News Record or equivalent successor index.\n(Rep. by ORD-17-00059, 6-19-17; Cr. by\nORD-18-00079\n, 8-3-18)\n(2)\nPark Impact Fees\n.\n(a)\nPolicy\n. In response to new and future development and population generating demands for\n new City parks and park infrastructure, the Common Council hereby establishes Park\n Impact Fees city-wide as the mechanism to equitably require all developments to pay\n for the costs that are necessary to accommodate the development. The Park Impact Fees\n shall include both a Park-Land Impact Fee and a Park-Infrastructure Impact Fee.\nThe Park-Land Impact Fee shall be the complementary mechanism to equitably require\n all developments to dedicate land for necessary parks and open spaces under Section\n16.23\n(6)(f), MGO, pay the Park-Land Impact Fee in lieu of dedication for public acquisition\n of parkland, or a combination of both.\nThe Park-Infrastructure Impact Fee, formerly known as the Park Development Impact\n Fee, shall be the mechanism to equitably require all developments to pay for necessary\n infrastructure in City parks to accommodate the development.\n(b)\nNeeds Assessment\n. For the purposes of the Park Impact Fees imposed under this subsection, a Park Needs\n Assessment has been prepared on a city-wide basis and is available for inspection\n at the Parks Division. The Needs Assessment provides the rationale and basis for the\n impact fees created under this Subsection.\n(c)\nCalculation of the Impact Fees\n.\n1.\nGeneral\n. The Park Impact Fees shall be imposed on individual properties based upon the type\n and number of dwelling units or lodging rooms to be generated by the property at the\n time of development, as set forth in this subdivision.\n2.\nPark Impact Fee Categories\n. Park Impact Fees shall be based upon the five following categories of development:\na.\nSingle-Family or Duplex\n.

The flood hazard areas regulated by this ordinance are divided into districts as\n follows:\n(a)\nThe Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions\n of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters,\n within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM, or within A Zones shown on the FIRM when determined\n according to this chapter.\n(b)\nThe Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of a riverine special flood hazard area\n outside the floodway within AE Zones on the FIRM, or, when floodway limits have been\n determined according to this chapter, within A Zones shown on the FIRM.\n(c)\nThe General Floodplain District (GFP) is those riverine areas that may be covered\n by floodwater during the regional flood in which a floodway boundary has not been\n delineated on the FIRM and also includes shallow flooding areas identified as AH and\n AO zones on the FIRM.\n(d)\nThe Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters\n is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge.\n(4)\nLocating Floodplain Boundaries\n. Discrepancies between the exterior boundaries of zones A1-30, AE, AH, or A on the\n official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions may be resolved using the\n criteria in subd (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall\n be amended according to subsection 21.29, Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can\n rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a zoning certificate,\n whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible\n for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the\n district boundary was determined. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an\n applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection\n21.25\n(3) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established\n base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision\n pursuant to subsection 21.29, Amendments.\n(a)\nIf flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine\n the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there\n are any discrepancies.\n(b)\nWhere flood profiles do not exist for projects, including any boundary of zone A or\n AO, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale.\n(5)\nRemoval of Lands from Floodplain\n.\n(a)\nCompliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing\n land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two (2) feet above the regional\n or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and\n the map is amended pursuant to subsection 21.29, Amendments.\n(b)\nThe delineation of any of the Floodplain Districts may be revised by the City where\n natural or human-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have\n been conducted. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from\n the DNR and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). A completed Letter of Map\n Revision is a record of this approval. The Zoning Administrator shall not sign a City\n acknowledgement form unless all criteria set forth in the following paragraphs are\n met:\n1.\nThe land and/or land around the structure must be filled at least two (2) feet above\n the regional or base flood elevation.\n2.\nThe fill must be contiguous to land outside the floodplain; Applicant shall obtain\n floodplain development zoning certificate before applying for a LOMR or LOMR-F.\n(c)\nRemoval of lands from the floodplain may also occur by operation of Wis Stat. \u00a7 87.30(1)(e),\n if a property owner has obtained a Letter of Map Amendment from FEMA under 44 C.F.R.\n 70.\n(6)\nCompliance\n.\n(a)\nNo structure or use within areas regulated by this ordinance shall hereafter be located,\n erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged, or altered\n without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other applicable\n regulations that apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these regulations.\n(b)\nFailure to obtain a floodplain development zoning certificates shall be a violation\n of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with subsection\n21.32\n.\n(c)\nFloodplain development zoning certificates issued on the basis of plans and applications\n approved by the Zoning Administrator authorize only the use, and arrangement, set\n forth in such approved plans and applications, or amendments thereto if approved by\n the Zoning Administrator. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that authorized\n shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in accordance with\n subsection\n21.32\n.\n(7)\nMunicipalities and State Agencies Regulated\n.\nUnless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are\n required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies\n are required to comply if Wis. Stat. \u00a7 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction,\n maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of\n Transportation (DOT) is exempt when Wis. Stat. \u00a7 30.2022 applies. Although exempt\n from a local zoning certificate and permit fees, DOT must provide sufficient project\n documentation and analysis to ensure that the community is in compliance with Federal,\n State, and local floodplain standards. If a local transportation project is located\n within a Zone A floodplain and is not a DOT project under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 30.2022, then\n the road project design documents (including appropriate detailed plans and profiles)\n may be sufficient to meet the requirements for issuance of a local floodplain permit\n if the following apply: The applicant provides documentation to the Zoning Administrator\n that the proposed project is a culvert replacement or bridge replacement under twenty\n (20) feet span at the same location, the project is exempt from a DNR permit under\n Wis. Stat. \u00a7 30.123(6)(d), the capacity is not decreased, the top road grade is not\n raised, and no floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other source.\n If floodway data is available in the impacted area from a federal, state, or other\n source that existing data must be utilized by the applicant in the analysis of the\n project site.\n(8)\nAbrogation and Greater Restrictions\n.\n(a)\nThis ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted\n under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.23, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance\n shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions,\n but not otherwise.\n(b)\nThis ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing deed restrictions,\n covenants, or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions\n of this ordinance shall prevail.\n(9)\nInterpretation\n.\nIn their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the\n minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the City and are not a limitation\n on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision\n of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision\n shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption\n of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this\n ordinance.\n(10)\nWarning and Disclaimer of Liability\n.\nThe flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience\n and research. Larger floods may occur, or the flood height may be increased by human\n made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain\n areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This\n ordinance does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against,\n the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from\n reliance on this ordinance.\n(11)\nSeverability\n.\nShould any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a\n court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected.\n(12)\nAnnexed Areas for Cities and Villages\n.\nThe Dane County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall\n remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until\n the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of\n ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\n These annexed lands are described on the City's Official Map. Dane County floodplain\n zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this\n section and are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator.
