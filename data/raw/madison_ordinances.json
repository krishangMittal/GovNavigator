    "content": "Footnotes:\n--- (\n1\n) ---\nEditor's note—\nORD-22-00128, published December 15, 2022, updated gender-inclusive language. Therefore,\n such ordinance made amendments to existing ordinances in Code to align with the City's\n gender-inclusive policies.\n\nIn the construction of the ordinances of the City of Madison the following rules shall\n be observed unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent\n of the ordinance.\n(1)\nGeneral Rule\n. All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common\n and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases and such others\n as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law shall be construed\n and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.\n(2)\nGender-Inclusive Language\n.\n(a)\nMadison General Ordinances shall be drafted with gender-inclusive language consistent\n with Administrative Procedure Memoranda 2-52 and its attachments and resources.\n(b)\nThe words \"they\", \"them\", and \"their\" may be used as a singular pronoun to refer to\n one individual person. The singular \"they\" is grammatically correct.\n(c)\nThe Common Council authorizes the Office of the City Attorney to make the appropriate\n changes to the ordinances consistent with this section and to implement the codification\n of such changes without further action of the Council.\n(Am. by\nORD-22-00128\n, 12-15-22)\n(3)\nPerson\n. The word \"person\" shall extend and be applied to firms, corporations, or voluntary\n associations, as well as to individuals, unless plainly inapplicable.\n(4)\nTenses\n. The use of any verb in the present tense shall include the future when applicable.\n(5)\nShall Have Been\n. The words \"shall have been\" include past and future cases.\n(6)\nHeretofore and Hereafter\n. Whenever the word \"heretofore\" occurs in any ordinance it shall be construed to\n mean any time previous to the day when such ordinance shall take effect; and whenever\n the word \"hereafter\" occurs it shall be construed to mean the time after the ordinance\n containing such word shall take effect.\n(7)\nJoint Authority\n. All words purporting to give a joint authority to three or more City officers or\n other persons shall be construed as giving such authority to a majority of such officers\n or other persons unless it shall be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving\n the authority.\n(8)\nActs By Agents\n. When an ordinance requires an act to be done which may by law as well be done by\n an agent as by the principal such requisition shall be construed to include all such\n acts when done by an authorized agent. Wherever these ordinances direct or allow a\n public official to take action, that action may be taken by the official's designee.\n (Am. by ORD-09-00004, 1-24-09)\n(9)\nReasonable Time\n. In all cases where any ordinance shall require any act to be done in a reasonable\n time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or notice shall be deemed\n to mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance of such duty,\n or compliance with such notice.\n(10)\nTime - How Computed\n. The time within which an act is to be done as provided in any ordinance or in any\n order issued pursuant to any ordinance, when expressed in days, shall be computed\n by excluding the first day and including the last, except that if the last day be\n Sunday or a holiday it shall be excluded; and when any such time is expressed in hours\n the whole of the Sunday or the holiday, from midnight to midnight, shall be excluded.\n Except as otherwise specified in these ordinances, \"holiday\" means a statewide legal\n holiday as provided in Sec. 995.20, Wis. Stats., provided, however, that when an act\n is permitted to be done by the use of the postal service, and the last day within\n the time prescribed by law for performing such act falls on a legal public holiday\n under federal law, or other holiday designated by the president such that the postal\n service does not receive registered mail or make regular deliveries on that day, the\n day shall be considered a legal holiday for purposes of this section. (Am. by Ord.\n 11,278, 6-19-95; Am. by\nORD-23-00008\n, 1-12-23)\n(11)\nWeek\n. The word \"week\" shall be construed to mean seven days; but publication in a newspaper\n of any notice or other matter indicated to be for a stated number of weeks shall be\n construed to mean one insertion in each week, unless specifically stated to be for\n each day of the week or for more than one day in each week; and all publications heretofore\n made in accordance with the terms of this subsection are hereby validated.\n(12)\nFine\n. The term \"fine\" shall be the equivalent of the word \"forfeiture.\"\n(13)\nReferences to Wisconsin Statutes\n. A reference to the Wisconsin State Statutes shall be construed to mean the most\n recent version of cited statute. (Cr. by ORD-14-00165, 10/29/14)\n(14)\nSingular and Plural\n. Every word in any ordinance importing the singular number shall extend and be applied\n to several persons or things as well as to one person or thing; and every word importing\n the plural number shall extend and be applied to one person or thing as well as to\n several persons or things. (Cr. by\nORD-22-00128\n, 12-15-22)\n\nThe rules of construction set forth in this chapter shall not be applied to any ordinance\n which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the\n subject matter or context of such ordinance may be repugnant thereto.\n\nIn addition to the rules of construction specified in Section\n1.01\n, the following rules shall be observed in the construction of these ordinances:\n(1)\nAll references to titles, chapters, or sections are to the titles, chapters and sections\n of these ordinances unless otherwise specified.\n(2)\nIf the provisions of different chapters of these ordinances conflict with or contravene\n each other, the provisions of each chapter shall prevail as to all matters and questions\n growing out of the subject matter of such chapter.\n(3)\nIf conflicting provisions be found in different sections of the same chapter the provisions\n of the section which is last in numerical order shall prevail unless such construction\n be inconsistent with the meaning of such chapter.\n\nAll ordinances passed by the Common Council, except when otherwise specifically provided,\n shall take effect and be in force from and after their publication.\n\nWhen any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or provision, shall be itself\n repealed, such repeal shall not be construed to revive such former ordinance, clause\n or provision, unless it shall be expressly so provided.\n\n(1)\nIn any case where there shall be a violation of any City ordinance for which no penalty\n is provided, the person violating the same shall be subject to a forfeiture of not\n less than one dollar ($1.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each\n offense, except as provided in the following subsection.\n(2)\nIn any case where any ordinance or section of an ordinance of the City of Madison\n shall not provide the greater penalty for a second or subsequent conviction for a\n violation thereof any person violating the same who shall previously have been convicted\n of a violation thereof shall be subject to a forfeiture of not less than ten dollars\n ($10) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200) for each offense, except that where\n the penalty provided by any such ordinance or section for a first violation thereof\n shall be larger than the penalty herein provided such larger penalty shall be applicable.\n(3)\nNo violation of any ordinance of the City of Madison shall be or be construed to be\n a misdemeanor nor shall imprisonment be imposed as a punishment for violation of any\n ordinance of the City of Madison except in the event of a failure of the defendant\n to pay the forfeiture imposed by the court, any other provision of the General Ordinances\n of the City of Madison to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nWhen a forfeiture shall be imposed for the violation of any ordinance of the City\n of Madison or any section thereof the court may also sentence the defendant to pay\n the cost of the action and to be imprisoned until such forfeiture and costs are paid,\n in no case, however, to exceed six (6) months, and the court may also issue an execution\n against the property of the defendant for said forfeiture and costs.\n\n(1)\nPursuant to the authority of Sec. 66.0113 of the Wisconsin Statutes, the City of Madison\n hereby elects to use the citation method of enforcement of ordinances including those\n for which a statutory counterpart exists. (Am. by Ord. 9623, 11-11-88)\n(2)\nThe Citation\n.\nThe citation shall be in compliance with Wis. Stat. § 800.02.\n(Sec. 1.08(2) Am. by Ord. 10,496, 8-28-92; ORD-13-00186, 11-25-13)\n(3)\nSchedule of Deposits\n.\n(a)\nThe schedule of cash deposits that follows this subsection is established for use\n with citations issued under this ordinance to persons seventeen (17) years of age\n and older.\n1.\nThe maximum cash deposit for persons twelve (12) to sixteen (16) years of age alleged\n to have committed a civil law or ordinance violation shall be fifty dollars ($50)\n plus the fees specified in Sec.\n1.08\n(3)(c), except for a violation of Sec.\n23.06\n, \"Damage to Property,\" Chapter 38 alcohol beverage violations, and traffic violations.\n (Am. by Ord. 13,760, Adopted 12-14-04)\n2.\nPursuant to Sec. 938.343, Wis.

    "content": "\n\n(1)\nThe government of the City of Madison is organized and constituted under Wis. Stat.\n ch. 62 providing for the City Mayor and Alder plan with a Common Council composed\n of twenty (20) alder, one (1) from each alder district. The Mayor and alders are to\n be elected for a term of two (2) years; provided, however, that beginning with the\n 1991 Spring Election, the Mayor shall be elected for a term of four (4) years, and\n that beginning with the 2025 Spring Election, alders shall be elected to staggered\n terms of two (2) years, with alders in even-numbered districts elected in even-numbered\n years and alders in odd-numbered districts being elected in odd-numbered years. To\n implement the staggered terms, the 2025 Spring Election shall include one-year terms\n for alders in even-numbered Districts. In subsequent elections the term for all alders\n shall be two (2) years. (Am. by\nORD-22-00127\n, 12-15-22)\n(2)\nExcept in cases of a resignation or other vacancy, all elected officials of the City\n of Madison will serve until their successors are elected and qualified. (Cr. by\nORD-20-00053\n, 6-10-20)\nThis is a charter ordinance and shall be effective upon sixty (60) days from passage\n and publication subject, however, to the referendum procedures of Wis. Stat. § 66.0101(5).\nEditor's note—\nSec. 3.01 was reinstated as a Charter Ordinance and amended to provide for four-year\n mayoral term pursuant to adoption by the electorate at the 1987 Spring Election of\n Res. No. 43,063, File No. 3885-86, amending Charter Ord. 39.\n(Am. by Ch. Ord. 67, 2-12-93; effective 4-17-93)\n\n(1)\nPolicy and Purpose\n. Because of the existing possibility of an attack upon the United States of unprecedented\n size and destructiveness, including the inevitable hazard of radioactive contamination,\n and in order, in the event of such an attack, to assure the continuation of effective,\n legally constituted leadership, authority and responsibilities in the offices of the\n government of the City of Madison, it is necessary to provide for emergency interim\n officers who can exercise the powers and discharge the duties of the Mayor, alders,\n supervisors, and department heads in the event that the incumbents are killed, missing,\n disabled, or for some other cause unable to perform the duties and functions of their\n offices during and immediately after an enemy attack. (Am. by ORD-09-00147, 11-6-09)\n(2)\nDefinitions\n. As used in this ordinance, unless the context otherwise clearly indicates:\n(a)\nUnavailable\nshall mean either that a vacancy in office exists and there is no deputy authorized\n to exercise all of the powers and discharge the duties of the office, or that the\n lawful incumbent of the office (including any deputy exercising the powers and discharging\n the duties of an office because of a vacancy) and her/his duly authorized deputy are\n absent or unable, for physical, mental or legal reasons, to exercise the powers and\n discharge the duties of the office. (Am. by ORD-14-00012, 1-14-14)\n(b)\nAttack\nshall mean any attack or series of attacks by an enemy of the United States causing,\n or which may cause, substantial damage or injury to persons or property in the United\n States by sabotage, the use of bombs, missiles, shellfire, or atomic, radiological,\n chemical, bacteriological, or biological means or other weapons or processes.\n(c)\nDuly authorized deputy\nshall mean a person who is presently authorized to perform all of the functions,\n exercise all of the powers and discharge all of the duties of an office in the event\n the office is vacant or at such times as it lacks administration due to the death,\n absence or disability of the incumbent officer.\n(d)\nEmergency interim successor\nshall mean a person designated pursuant to this ordinance for possible temporary\n succession to the powers and duties, but not the office, of a City officer in the\n event that such officer or any duly authorized deputy is unavailable to exercise the\n powers and discharge the duties of the office.\n(3)\nDesignation, Status, Qualifications and Term of Emergency Interim Successors\n. Succession of the office of Mayor shall be in the following order: president of\n the Common Council, vice president of the Common Council, and two (2) emergency interim\n successors to be named by the Mayor within thirty (30) days after this ordinance is\n adopted, and by each Mayor within thirty (30) days of her/his taking office, and the\n Mayor shall specify and rank in order of succession after the vice president of the\n Common Council, so that there will be no less than two (2) duly authorized emergency\n interim successors for the office of Mayor. (Am. by ORD-14-00012, 1-14-14; ORD-16-00080,\n Pub. 9-15-16, Eff. 4-18-17)\n(a)\nWhoever is nominated and whatever succession is designated shall be confirmed by the\n Common Council.\n(b)\n(R. by Ord. 6703, 8-8-79)\n(c)\nDepartment Heads\n. Within thirty (30) days after adoption of this ordinance, each department head shall\n appoint and specify the order of succession, after her/his deputy, of two (2) emergency\n interim successors, so that there will be not less than three (3) successors to the\n office of each department head. If there is no deputy, three (3) emergency interim\n successors shall be so appointed instead of two (2).\nEmergency interim successors to department heads shall be confirmed by the Mayor.\n (Am. by ORD-14-00012, 1-14-14)\n(d)\nReview of Designations\n. The Mayor, alders, supervisors, and department heads shall review and, if necessary,\n revise and keep current the designations of emergency interim successors to insure\n at all times that there is the requisite number of qualified emergency interim successors.\n (Am. by ORD-09-00147, 11-6-09)\n(e)\nQualifications\n. No person shall be designated or serve as an emergency interim successor unless\n he or she may under the constitution and statutes of this state and the charter ordinances\n of this City, hold the office of the person to whose powers and duties he or she is\n designated to succeed, but no provision of any ordinance prohibiting an officer or\n employee of this City from holding another office shall be applicable to an emergency\n interim successor.\nEmergency interim successors shall act only until the Common Council can meet as a\n body and appoint and confirm a successor to the Mayor, alders, and supervisors if\n necessary in accordance with existing statute. (Am. by ORD-09-00147, 11-6-09; ORD-14-00012,\n 1-14-14)\n(f)\nStatus of Emergency Interim Successor\n. A person designated as an emergency interim successor holds that designation at\n the pleasure of the designator; provided, that he or she must be replaced if removed.\n He or she retains this designation as emergency interim successor until replaced by\n another appointed by the authorized designator, or until the designator leaves office.\n (Am. by ORD-14-00012, 1-14-14)\n(4)\nAssumption of Powers and Duties of Officer by Emergency Interim Successor\n. If in the event of an attack the Mayor, any alder, or any department head and any\n duly authorized deputy is unavailable, her/his emergency interim successor highest\n in rank in order of succession who is available shall, except for the power and duty\n to appoint emergency interim successors, exercise the powers and discharge the duties\n of such officer. An emergency interim successor shall exercise these powers and discharge\n these duties only until such time as the lawful incumbent officer or any duly authorized\n deputy or an emergency interim successor higher in rank in order of succession exercises,\n or resumes the exercise of, the powers and discharge of the duties of the office,\n or until, where an actual vacancy exists, a successor is appointed to fill such vacancy\n or is elected and qualified as provided by law. (Am. by ORD-09-00147, 11-6-09; ORD-14-00012,\n 1-14-14)\n(5)\nRecording and Publication\n. The name, address and rank in order of succession of each duly authorized deputy\n and emergency interim successor shall be filed with the City Clerk and each designation,\n replacement, or change in order of succession of an emergency interim successor shall\n become effective when the designator files with the City Clerk the successor's name,\n address, and rank in order of succession. The City Clerk shall keep on file all such\n data regarding duly authorized deputies and emergency interim successors which shall\n be open to public inspection.\n(6)\nFormalities of Taking Office\n. At the time of their designation, emergency interim successors shall take such oath\n and do such other things, if any, as may be required to qualify them to exercise the\n powers and discharge the duties of the office to which they may succeed.\n(7)\nEmergency Meetings of the Governing Body\n. During any emergency:\n(a)\nAny member of the Common Council or a legally constituted successor may call a meeting\n of the Common Council by notifying all members or their interim successors so far\n as practicable and by whatever means available of the time and place of such meeting,\n within or without the City or state as circumstances dictate.\n(b)\nThe members so meeting shall establish and be governed by its own rules during such\n emergency.\n(8)\nSeparability Clause\n.\n(a)\nIf any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this ordinance\n is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction,\n such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such\n holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.\n(b)\nAll ordinances or a part thereof contravening the provisions of this ordinance are\n repealed.\n(Renum. by Ord. 13,308, 4-30-03; Renum. by ORD-06-00176, 12-8-06)\n\n(1)\nThe Mayor shall be elected on each odd numbered year for a term of two (2) years.\n Beginning with the 1991 Spring Election, the Mayor shall be elected every other odd\n numbered year for a term of four (4) years. The Mayor shall devote her/his entire\n time to the duties of the office of Mayor. The Mayor shall have the general supervision\n of all City officers and heads of departments in the performance of their official\n duties.\nThis is a charter ordinance and shall be effective upon sixty (60) days from passage\n and publication subject, however, to the referendum procedures of Section 66.0101(5),\n Wisconsin Statutes. ED.

The Madison Police Department (MPD) has historically responded to all alarm activations\n within the City of Madison. The incidence of false alarms has increased on an annual\n basis and is expected to continue to increase as the City grows and the number of\n alarm installations grows with it. Today, the false alarm rate is approximately ninety-seven\n percent (97%). In 1983, in response to a false alarm rate of ninety-eight percent\n (98%), the Madison Common Council enacted Sec.\n5.08\n, MGO, with a provision to penalize businesses and residences for false alarm calls\n responded to by MPD. The ordinance established a graduated penalty structure based\n upon the number of false alarm calls in a twelve (12) month cycle. The MPD crime prevention\n office handles the compiling of data related to false alarms and the citation paperwork.\n The crime prevention office has had to dedicate increasing hours to handling false\n alarms. This increase has reduced the Crime Prevention Officer's ability to focus\n on the primary goals of the Crime Prevention Unit, which are outreach and education\n relative to personal safety and property security. The time spent responding to and\n searching locations where false alarms are activated may endanger the public by preventing,\n diverting or delaying police officers from patrolling a neighborhood, responding to\n calls for service, including bona fide emergencies, and investigating and solving\n crimes. Time spent responding to false alarms also reduces the amount of time officers\n can devote to important community policing efforts. Based upon these findings, the\n City of Madison Police Department will now respond to certain alarm devices only when\n the response has been verified as set forth in this Ordinance.\nThe purpose of this section is to establish standards and controls of the various\n types of emergency alarm signals from alarm devices or systems that require a police\n response. This section applies to any person, business, firm, corporation or any commercial\n entity owning, operating or maintaining any alarm devices or alarm systems designed\n to summon the police to any location in response to a signal or other transmission\n generated or produced by such devices.\n(2)\nDefinitions\n. For the purpose of this Ordinance, the following definitions shall apply:\n\"Alarm\" means any sound, signal or message generated by an alarm system, alarm user\n or other person, to which police personnel are expected to respond.\n\"Alarm user\" means the person, partnership, corporation or other entity of any kind\n in control of any building, structure or facility or portion thereof, wherein an alarm\n system is in operation.\n\"Alarm System\" means any system, device, or mechanism which, when activated, transmits\n a telephonic, wireless, electronic, video, or other form of message to an alarm system\n monitoring company, or some other number, or emits an audible or visible signal that\n can be heard or seen by persons outside the protected premises, or transmits a signal\n beyond the premises in some other fashion, except any system, device, or mechanism\n primarily protecting a motor vehicle or a medical alert alarm. An alarm system or\n alarm device may consist of one or more components (e.g. motion detector, window breach\n detector or similar components) all reporting to a central alarm station.\n\"Automatic dial device\" means any device that automatically sends over regular telephone\n lines, by direct connection, a prerecorded voice message or coded signal indicating\n the existence of some type of emergency to which police ",

This analysis is intended\n to give guidance on equity issues affecting the plan or project, or on best uses of\n the property, consistent with the EFA, to serve under-represented communities, and\n help form a RFP process to get a diverse response pool under subsection (d).\n(e)\nIn the event the Economic Feasibility Analysis determines that the Surplus Real Property\n is not independently developable, then the EDD Director and the Director of the Department\n of Planning and Economic and Community Development (\"DPECD\"), after consultation with\n the Alderperson of the alder district within which the Surplus Real Property is located,\n shall determine if it is in the best interests of the City to sell the Surplus Real\n Property by direct sale to tenants who currently lease or occupy the Surplus Real\n Property, tenants who currently lease or occupy an abutting property located within\n the City of Madison, or to owner(s) of an abutting property located within the City\n of Madison. If it is determined, in the opinion of the Alderperson, that such a sale\n is in the best interests of the City, and there is only one party interested in purchasing\n the Surplus Real Property, the terms and conditions of the sale shall be submitted\n to the Common Council for approval. If more than one of the prospective purchasers\n described in this subdivision express interest in the property, the procedures described\n in sub. (d) shall apply, except that the Committee described in sub. (f) may limit\n bids to these prospective purchasers.\n(f)\nIf subs. (a) and (b) do not apply, and following compliance with subs. (c) and (d),\n the EDD and DPECD Directors, after consultation with the Alderperson of the alder\n district within which the Surplus Real Property is located, shall determine if it\n is in the best interests of the City, based upon the findings of the EFA and equity\n analysis, to dispose of the Surplus Real Property either by direct sale or through\n a public bid process. If it is determined that it is in the best interests of the\n City to dispose of the property by direct sale, the terms and conditions of the sale\n shall be submitted to the Common Council for approval. If it is determined to be in\n the best interests of the City to dispose of the property through a public bid process,\n staff shall create a Request for Proposals (\"RFP\"), incorporating recommendations\n from the equity analysis. The Mayor shall create a Criteria and Selection Committee\n (\"Committee\") and appoint the members who shall perform the duties herein described.\n1.\nCommittee Membership\n. It is the City's desire to have a Committee that is diverse in race, ethnicity,\n and gender.

The Committee shall be responsible for the following:\na.\nIdentification of the type of use desired for the Surplus Real Property and any special\n terms or conditions that are important to the City.\nb.\nEstablishment of criteria with point values to be used in the evaluation of bid proposals\n submitted by potential purchasers of the Surplus Real Property.\nc.\nEvaluation of the bid proposals submitted by potential purchasers and selection of\n the purchaser.\n3.\nCommon Council Concurrence\n. Once the Committee establishes the criteria and point values, the Real Estate Manager\n shall prepare a resolution for introduction to the Common Council directing the Real\n Estate Manager to proceed with the public bid process for the sale of the Surplus\n Real Property.\n4.\nBid Proposal Selection\n. The Committee shall receive, open, and evaluate the bid proposals subject to the\n selection criteria and point values.

The Committee shall reserve\n the right to reject any and all bid proposals. Upon selection of a bid proposal, the\n Real Estate Manager shall prepare a resolution for adoption by the Common Council\n accepting the Committee's selection and authorizing the sale of the Surplus Real Property.\n5.\nSurplus Property Conveyance\n.

The following provisions shall apply for the revocation or suspension of any license\n issued pursuant to the provision of this section of the Madison General Ordinances.\n(a)\nComplaint\n.

If any new amendment\n or ordinance enacted by the Common Council shall provide for revocation of all or\n any class of existing licenses and the issuance of new licenses or shall impose such\n new restrictions as to render it impossible for any licensee under an existing license\n to meet such restrictions, then and in such case the unused portion of the fee paid\n for such license shall be refunded or applied on any new license issued to such licensee\n by the Common Council. In case of revocation of any license or any violation of any\n provision of this Ordinance in accordance with this section or for any reasonable\n cause except the imposition of new restrictions, no refund shall be made of any part\n of the license fee.

It shall also be unlawful for any person to represent\n themselves to be a parent or guardian of any person under the age of eighteen (18)\n in order that such person may obtain admission to a public dance when the person making\n this representation is not in fact either a parent or legal guardian of such other\n person.

In the exercise of its police powers, the City has priority over all other uses\n of the public rights-of-way. The City desires to anticipate and minimize the number\n of obstructions and excavations taking place in the public rights-of-way to ensure\n that the rights-of-way remain available for public services and safe for public use,\n and to ensure that facilities are timely maintained, supported, protected or relocated\n to accommodate reconstruction or repairs. The taxpayers of the City bear the financial\n burden for the upkeep, maintenance and reconstruction of the rights-of-way and a primary\n cause for the early and excessive deterioration of the public rights-of-way is the\n frequent excavation by persons who place facilities therein.\nThe City finds that there has been an increase in the use of the public rights-of-way\n and, as a result, increased costs to the taxpayers of the City and that these costs\n are likely to continue into the foreseeable future.\nThe City finds that delays by occupants of the rights-of-ways in maintaining, supporting,\n protecting or relocating facilities, if they impact public construction projects,\n have the potential to significantly increase public works project costs borne by the\n taxpayers. Moreover, the City finds that some right-of-way occupants have a history\n of delays and nonresponsiveness.\nThe City finds that occupancy and excavation of its rights-of-way causes direct and\n indirect costs to be borne by the City and its taxpayers, including but not limited\n to:\n1.\nAdministrative costs associated with public right-of-way projects, such as registration,\n permitting, inspection and supervision, supplies and materials;\n2.\nManagement costs associated with ongoing management activities necessitated by public\n right-of-way users;\n3.\nRepair or restoration costs to the roadway associated with the actual excavation into\n the public right-of-way; and,\n4.\nDegradation costs defined as depreciation caused to the roadway in terms of decreased\n useful life, due to excavations into the public rights-of-way.\nIn response to the foregoing facts, and pursuant to its authority under Wis. Stat.\n §§ 62.11(5), 86.16, 182.017, and 196.58, the City hereby enacts this ordinance relating\n to the administration of and permits to excavate, obstruct and/or occupy the public\n rights-of-way. This ordinance imposes reasonable regulations on the placement and\n maintenance of facilities currently within its rights-of-way or to be placed therein\n at some future time. It is intended to complement the regulatory roles of state and\n federal agencies.\nThe purpose of this ordinance is to provide the City a legal framework within which\n to regulate and manage the public rights-of-way, and to provide for the recovery of\n costs incurred by the City in doing so.

The owner\n or operator of the property shall only use parts or materials approved by the Water\n Utility or contained in the Water Utility's standards and specifications. It shall\n be the responsibility of the owner or operator of the property to ensure that repairs\n and modifications meet such standards and specifications, or have such approval.\n(e)\nAbatement of Water Pit Hazards\n. If the General Manager of the Water Utility, or their designee, determines that\n the design or condition of an existing water meter pit is a serious hazard to the\n health or safety of the Utility's employees or to the public, then the General Manager\n may order the owner or operator to repair or replace the water meter pit at the owner\n or operator's expense, pursuant to this subsection. An owner or operator may also\n comply with such an order by removing the water pit.\n1.\nSummary Abatement of Water Pit Hazard\n.\na.\nOrder of Abatement\n. If the General Manager of the Water Utility determines that a water meter pit constitutes\n a public nuisance and that there is imminent danger to the public health, safety,\n peace, comfort or welfare, they may, without notice or hearing, issue an order to\n the owner and/or operator reciting the existence of a public nuisance constituting\n imminent danger to the public and requiring immediate action be taken as they deem\n necessary to abate the nuisance. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection,\n the order shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is directed\n shall comply with the order immediately.\nb.\nAbatement by the Utility\n. Whenever the owner or operator shall refuse or neglect to remove or abate the condition\n described in the order, the Director of the Water Utility may, in their discretion,\n enter upon the property and cause the nuisance to be removed or abated and the Water\n Utility shall recover the expenses incurred thereby from the owner or operator of\n the property. The expenses so incurred may be levied as a special charge against the\n property.\n2.\nNonsummary Abatement of Water Pit Hazard\n.\na.\nOrder to Abate Nuisance\n. If the Director of the Water Utility determines that a water meter pit constitutes\n a public nuisance but that the nature of such nuisance is not such as to threaten\n imminent danger to the public health, safety, peace, comfort or welfare, they shall\n issue an order reciting the existence of a public nuisance and requiring the owner\n and/or operator of the property to remove or abate the condition described in the\n order within the time period specified therein. The order shall be served personally\n on the owner of the property, as well as the operator if different from the owner\n and applicable to the described nuisance, or, at the option of the Director of the\n Water Utility, the notice may be mailed to the last known address of the person to\n be served by registered mail with return receipt requested. If the owner or the operator\n cannot be served, the order may be served by posting it on the main entrance of the\n premises and by publishing as a class 1 notice under Wis. Stat. ch. 985. The time\n limit specified in the order runs from the date of service or publication.\nb.\nAbatement by the Utility\n. If the owner or operator fails or refuses to comply within the time period prescribed,\n the Director of Water Utility may enter upon the property and cause the nuisance to\n be removed or abated and the Water Utility shall recover the expenses incurred thereby\n from the owner or operator of the property.

(See also Chapter 194, Laws of 1907.)\n\n(1)\nA dock line is hereby established on Lake Monona as follows: Beginning on the extension\n of Emerald Street at a point where the dock line in front of Blocks 14 and 19 in said\n city ends, it being 315 feet from the east line of South Park Street, extending thence\n in a southerly direction parallel to South Park Street past and across said Block\n 20 and the extension of Erin Street, thence across Block 25 by a curve convex to the\n shore with a radius of 438 feet to a point of tangency with the dock line established\n in the Town of Madison adjacent to Greenbush Addition to the City of Madison.\n(2)\nThis act is passed for the purpose of improving navigation in said Lake Monona Bay,\n and also because it is desirable for sanitary reasons to fill and grade up the marsh\n near said shoreline, and out to or near said dock line established in subsection (1)\n of this section.\n(3)\nSuch dock line is hereby established upon the condition that the owners of the abutting\n property shall lease to the City of Madison for street, boulevard and park purposes,\n under certain conditions as contained in a lease to the Madison Park and Pleasure\n Drive Association signed by T.

Butler and others, all of the land\n lying between said dock line and a line 240 feet easterly of the east line of said\n Park Street and parallel thereto.\n(4)\nWhereas the owners of said Blocks 20 and 25 have heretofore completed the filling\n out to said dock line, such filling is hereby fully ratified, confirmed and approved\n upon the conditions named in subsection (3) hereof.\n\n(1)\nA dock line is hereby established on Lake Monona as follows: Beginning at a point\n on the south line of Erin Street extended, 315 feet east of the east line of South\n Park Street, thence north and parallel to said east line of South Park Street to a\n point 109 feet south of the south line of West Washington Avenue extended, thence\n by a curve to the right within a radius of 100 feet turning at an angle of 90 degrees\n to a point 9 feet south of the south line of said West Washington Avenue extended,\n and 415 feet east of the east line of Park Street.\n(2)\nThe reason for establishing such dock line is that the water covering the bed of said\n lake out to the dock line is and has been for many years so low and stagnant and in\n such foul condition as to endanger public health, which condition will be removed\n and at the same time the bed of said lake improved for fishing and navigation purposes\n by the filling out to said dock line.\n(3)\nSuch dock line is hereby established upon condition that the owners of the abutting\n property shall convey to the City of Madison by quitclaim deed, for street purposes\n only, the land in or opposite such blocks lying between a line 240 feet east of the\n east line of South Park Street and a line 306 feet east of said east line of said\n street, and shall further convey, either to the City of Madison or to the Madison\n Park and Pleasure Drive Association or its successors or assigns, in trust for the\n City of Madison, by quitclaim deed, for park purposes only, this strip of land lying\n between the said dock line and said line 306 feet east of the east line of South Park\n Street, such deed to contain a condition that in case any of the land so conveyed\n shall ever be used for any purposes other than those specified, or if any building\n or structure of any kind except the boathouses hereinafter mentioned shall ever be\n erected or maintained upon any of the property so conveyed, the same shall revert\n to the grantors; and the deed of said strip beyond the 306 foot line to contain a\n further provision reserving to the grantors, their heirs and assigns, their riparian\n rights and the right to construct and maintain upon the land thereby conveyed opposite\n each block one boathouse for the joint and exclusive use of all persons owning land\n in such block, who shall contribute their pro rata share of the expense of constructing\n and maintaining the same, such boathouse to be located at some appropriate and convenient\n point to be designated by the Board of Park Commissioners of the City of Madison and\n by said owners, and to be constructed of material suitable for the boathouse and according\n to a design to be approved by said Board of Park Commissioners, it being understood\n that said boathouse shall not require, either in material to be used or the design\n adopted, any unreasonable expenditure of money; and said deed to contain a further\n reservation to the grantors, their heirs and assigns, of the right of access to the\n lake across said strip, such right to be exercised, however, at such place and in\n such a way as not necessarily to injure or interfere with any planting or other improvements\n to said strip, either by the City or by said Park Board. Conveyances as aforesaid\n for the street and park purposes of the land in or opposite any of the aforesaid Blocks\n 14, 19 and 20, shall be deemed a compliance as to such block with the foregoing conditions\n and thereupon, as to such block, the dock line aforesaid shall become established.\n(4)\nWhereas the owners of the land opposite said Blocks 14 and 19 have heretofore completed\n the filling out to said dock line, such filling is hereby ratified, confirmed and\n approved upon the conditions named in subsection (3) hereof.\n(5)\nThe owners of property in said Block 20 are hereby authorized to fill out to said\n dock line to the same depth and upon the same grade or slope as the filling in said\n Blocks 14 and 19, on the conditions contained in subsection (3) hereof.\n(6)\nThe public streets crossed by said dock line, namely Erin, Emerald and Drake, shall\n be considered as extended as public streets out to said dock line, and the rights\n of the City in the portion of said streets so extended shall be the same as in other\n parts of said street.\n\n(1)\nA dock line is hereby established on the shore of Lake Monona as follows: Beginning\n at a point immediately below the center line of the main track of the Chicago, Milwaukee,\n St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company right-of-way, Prairie du Chien Division, distant\n 800 feet southeasterly from the northwest line of West Wilson Street extended, said\n 800 feet being measured along the center line of the above-mentioned track; thence\n by a curve to the left with a radius of 300 feet, the center of said curve being 500\n feet southeasterly from the northwest line of West Wilson Street and in the center\n of the above-mentioned track, turning a total angle of 40 degrees and 45 minutes;\n thence by a curve to the right with a radius of 1,800 feet, turning a total angle\n of 23 degrees; thence by a curve to the right with a radius of 400 feet, turning a\n total angle of 67 degrees and 30 minutes, to a point distant 591 feet southeast from\n the southeast line of West Wilson Street measured on a line 6 feet northeast of the\n southwest line of Bassett Street in said City of Madison.\n(2)\nThe City of Madison is hereby authorized to fill out from the present shoreline to\n said dock line sufficient depth for the purpose of removing the unsanitary and offensive\n condition of the bed of the lake between the said shoreline and said dock line, and\n for the purpose of aiding navigation of the waters of said lake. The land formed by\n the filling, as herein authorized, shall belong to the State of Wisconsin, and is\n hereby forever set aside for public park purposes.

(Am. by ORD-06-00091,\n 8-2-06)\n\n(1)\nDevelopment Impact Fee Zones are established as shown on the Development Impact Fee\n Zones Map. Such development impact fee zones will be established consistent with any\n facility service areas and public facility needs assessment for each public facility.\n(2)\nAdditional development impact fee zones or combinations of development impact fee\n zones may be designated by the Common Council consistent with the procedure set forth\n in this ordinance and with Wis. Stat. § 66.0617.\n\n(1)\nWest Elderberry Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement Impact Fee\n.\n(a)\nIn response to new and future Development demands in the Lower Badger Mill Creek watershed,\n in the area generally west of Schewe Road and Bear Claw Way, and east of Pioneer Road\n (extended north and south), and north of Mineral Point Road and south of Old Sauk\n Road, on the far west side of Madison, additional new public sanitary sewer facilities\n must be constructed to allow such Developments to proceed. Specifically, to adequately\n serve this new and future Development, the City must extend and construct new sanitary\n sewer interceptors. Therefore, the Common Council hereby establishes the West Elderberry\n Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement Impact Fee District as a mechanism to equitably\n charge all new Developments in this District their proportional share of the cost\n for necessary sanitary sewer improvements in the watershed.\nFor purposes of the Sanitary Sewer Improvement Impact Fee imposed under this section,\n the said District shall be all existing undeveloped land that currently drains or\n is altered to drain to the West Elderberry Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement\n drainage area, as more specifically described and identified as follows:\nAny and all undeveloped parcels (platted and/or metes and bounds), or portions thereof,\n located within, or that are altered or pumped to discharge sewer outflow within the\n West Elderberry Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement service area. These lands\n are located within the City of Madison and the Town of Middleton as follows: Parts\n of the NE ¼ of Section 20, all of the SE ¼ of Section 20, and parts of the SW ¼ of\n Section 21, all within Town 7 North, Range 8 East, located in the Town of Middleton\n and the City of Madison.\nThe said District shall also be shown on the Development Impact Fee District Map.\n(b)\nCalculation of the Impact Fee\n. The amount of the West Elderberry Sanitary Sewer Improvement Impact Fee to be imposed\n on individual properties shall be calculated based on the amount of Net Developable\n Area of the land being developed within the above-described District. The subject\n Impact Fee is based upon the estimated Cost to construct the necessary public improvements.\n Prior to the recording of any certified survey map or any final Subdivision Plat,\n or the issuance of building permits following approval of a rezoning or conditional\n use permit, the City shall calculate the amount of net area being developed, based\n on the proposed certified survey map, final Subdivision Plat, or other applicable\n public records.\nIn the undeveloped areas of the West Elderberry Neighborhood Sanitary Sewer Improvement\n Impact Fee District, the Impact Fee shall be $109.26 per 1,000 square feet of Net\n Developed Area. In areas already developed without public sanitary sewer, the Impact\n Fee does not apply, but these parcels may be specially assessed or charged connection\n fees for sanitary sewer service at a rate of $109.26 per 1,000 square feet.\nThe said Impact Fee, special assessment, and connection fee rates are established\n in 2018 dollars and shall be indexed for inflation annually (January 1st) thereafter\n with June, 2018 as the base, using the Construction Cost Index as published by the\n Engineering News Record or equivalent successor index.\n(Rep. by ORD-17-00059, 6-19-17; Cr. by\nORD-18-00079\n, 8-3-18)\n(2)\nPark Impact Fees\n.\n(a)\nPolicy\n. In response to new and future development and population generating demands for\n new City parks and park infrastructure, the Common Council hereby establishes Park\n Impact Fees city-wide as the mechanism to equitably require all developments to pay\n for the costs that are necessary to accommodate the development. The Park Impact Fees\n shall include both a Park-Land Impact Fee and a Park-Infrastructure Impact Fee.\nThe Park-Land Impact Fee shall be the complementary mechanism to equitably require\n all developments to dedicate land for necessary parks and open spaces under Section\n16.23\n(6)(f), MGO, pay the Park-Land Impact Fee in lieu of dedication for public acquisition\n of parkland, or a combination of both.\nThe Park-Infrastructure Impact Fee, formerly known as the Park Development Impact\n Fee, shall be the mechanism to equitably require all developments to pay for necessary\n infrastructure in City parks to accommodate the development.\n(b)\nNeeds Assessment\n. For the purposes of the Park Impact Fees imposed under this subsection, a Park Needs\n Assessment has been prepared on a city-wide basis and is available for inspection\n at the Parks Division. The Needs Assessment provides the rationale and basis for the\n impact fees created under this Subsection.\n(c)\nCalculation of the Impact Fees\n.\n1.\nGeneral\n. The Park Impact Fees shall be imposed on individual properties based upon the type\n and number of dwelling units or lodging rooms to be generated by the property at the\n time of development, as set forth in this subdivision.\n2.\nPark Impact Fee Categories\n. Park Impact Fees shall be based upon the five following categories of development:\na.\nSingle-Family or Duplex\n. Includes all types of single-family dwelling units, including single-family detached\n dwellings, single-family attached dwellings and two-family dwelling uni",

Stat. § 62.23, for\n cities; and the requirements in Wis. Stat. §. 87.30.\n(Cr. by\nORD-25-00012\n, 3-20-25)\n\nUncontrolled development and use of the floodplains and rivers of the City would impair\n the public health, safety, convenience, general welfare, and tax base.\n(Cr. by\nORD-25-00012\n, 3-20-25)\n\nThis ordinance is intended to regulate floodplain development to:\n(1)\nProtect life, health and property;\n(2)\nMinimize expenditures of public funds for flood control projects;\n(3)\nMinimize rescue and relief efforts undertaken at the expense of the taxpayers;\n(4)\nMinimize business interruptions and other economic disruptions;\n(5)\nMinimize damage to public facilities in the floodplain;\n(6)\nMinimize the occurrence of future flood blight areas in the floodplain;\n(7)\nDiscourage the victimization of unwary land and homebuyers;\n(8)\nPrevent increases in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in\n conflicts between property owners; and\n(9)\nDiscourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to\n locate the activity, use or structure outside of the floodplain.\n(Cr. by\nORD-25-00012\n, 3-20-25)\n\n(1)\nAreas to be Regulated\n. This ordinance regulates all areas of special flood hazard identified as zones A,\n AO, AH, A1-30, or AE on the Flood Insurance Rate Map. Additional areas identified\n on maps approved by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the City may also\n be regulated under the provisions of this ordinance, where applicable.\n(2)\nOfficial Maps and Revisions\n. Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) are designated as zones A, A1-30, AE, AH, or AO\n on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) based on flood hazard analyses summarized\n in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) listed in subd. (a) below. Additional flood hazard\n areas subject to regulation under this ordinance are identified on maps based on studies\n approved by the DNR and listed in subd. (b) below.

The flood hazard areas regulated by this ordinance are divided into districts as\n follows:\n(a)\nThe Floodway District (FW), is the channel of a river or stream and those portions\n of the floodplain adjoining the channel required to carry the regional floodwaters,\n within AE Zones as shown on the FIRM, or within A Zones shown on the FIRM when determined\n according to this chapter.\n(b)\nThe Floodfringe District (FF) is that portion of a riverine special flood hazard area\n outside the floodway within AE Zones on the FIRM, or, when floodway limits have been\n determined according to this chapter, within A Zones shown on the FIRM.\n(c)\nThe General Floodplain District (GFP) is those riverine areas that may be covered\n by floodwater during the regional flood in which a floodway boundary has not been\n delineated on the FIRM and also includes shallow flooding areas identified as AH and\n AO zones on the FIRM.\n(d)\nThe Flood Storage District (FSD) is that area of the floodplain where storage of floodwaters\n is calculated to reduce the regional flood discharge.\n(4)\nLocating Floodplain Boundaries\n. Discrepancies between the exterior boundaries of zones A1-30, AE, AH, or A on the\n official floodplain zoning map and actual field conditions may be resolved using the\n criteria in subd (a) or (b) below. If a significant difference exists, the map shall\n be amended according to subsection 21.29, Amendments. The Zoning Administrator can\n rely on a boundary derived from a profile elevation to grant or deny a zoning certificate,\n whether or not a map amendment is required. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible\n for documenting actual pre-development field conditions and the basis upon which the\n district boundary was determined. Disputes between the Zoning Administrator and an\n applicant over the district boundary line shall be settled according to subsection\n21.25\n(3) and the criteria in (a) and (b) below. Where the flood profiles are based on established\n base flood elevations from a FIRM, FEMA must approve any map amendment or revision\n pursuant to subsection 21.29, Amendments.\n(a)\nIf flood profiles exist, the map scale and the profile elevations shall determine\n the district boundary. The regional or base flood elevations shall govern if there\n are any discrepancies.\n(b)\nWhere flood profiles do not exist for projects, including any boundary of zone A or\n AO, the location of the boundary shall be determined by the map scale.\n(5)\nRemoval of Lands from Floodplain\n.\n(a)\nCompliance with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be grounds for removing\n land from the floodplain unless it is filled at least two (2) feet above the regional\n or base flood elevation, the fill is contiguous to land outside the floodplain, and\n the map is amended pursuant to subsection 21.29, Amendments.\n(b)\nThe delineation of any of the Floodplain Districts may be revised by the City where\n natural or human-made changes have occurred and/or where more detailed studies have\n been conducted. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from\n the DNR and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). A completed Letter of Map\n Revision is a record of this approval. The Zoning Administrator shall not sign a City\n acknowledgement form unless all criteria set forth in the following paragraphs are\n met:\n1.\nThe land and/or land around the structure must be filled at least two (2) feet above\n the regional or base flood elevation.\n2.\nThe fill must be contiguous to land outside the floodplain; Applicant shall obtain\n floodplain development zoning certificate before applying for a LOMR or LOMR-F.\n(c)\nRemoval of lands from the floodplain may also occur by operation of Wis Stat. § 87.30(1)(e),\n if a property owner has obtained a Letter of Map Amendment from FEMA under 44 C.F.R.\n 70.\n(6)\nCompliance\n.\n(a)\nNo structure or use within areas regulated by this ordinance shall hereafter be located,\n erected, constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged, or altered\n without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other applicable\n regulations that apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these regulations.\n(b)\nFailure to obtain a floodplain development zoning certificates shall be a violation\n of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with subsection\n21.32\n.\n(c)\nFloodplain development zoning certificates issued on the basis of plans and applications\n approved by the Zoning Administrator authorize only the use, and arrangement, set\n forth in such approved plans and applications, or amendments thereto if approved by\n the Zoning Administrator. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that authorized\n shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in accordance with\n subsection\n21.32\n.\n(7)\nMunicipalities and State Agencies Regulated\n.\nUnless specifically exempted by law, all cities, villages, towns, and counties are\n required to comply with this ordinance and obtain all necessary permits. State agencies\n are required to comply if Wis. Stat. § 13.48(13) applies. The construction, reconstruction,\n maintenance and repair of state highways and bridges by the Wisconsin Department of\n Transportation (DOT) is exempt when Wis. Stat. § 30.2022 applies. Although exempt\n from a local zoning certificate and permit fees, DOT must provide sufficient project\n documentation and analysis to ensure that the community is in compliance with Federal,\n State, and local floodplain standards. If a local transportation project is located\n within a Zone A floodplain and is not a DOT project under Wis. Stat. § 30.2022, then\n the road project design documents (including appropriate detailed plans and profiles)\n may be sufficient to meet the requirements for issuance of a local floodplain permit\n if the following apply: The applicant provides documentation to the Zoning Administrator\n that the proposed project is a culvert replacement or bridge replacement under twenty\n (20) feet span at the same location, the project is exempt from a DNR permit under\n Wis. Stat. § 30.123(6)(d), the capacity is not decreased, the top road grade is not\n raised, and no floodway data is available from a federal, state, or other source.\n If floodway data is available in the impacted area from a federal, state, or other\n source that existing data must be utilized by the applicant in the analysis of the\n project site.\n(8)\nAbrogation and Greater Restrictions\n.\n(a)\nThis ordinance supersedes all the provisions of any municipal zoning ordinance enacted\n under Wis. Stat. § 62.23, which relate to floodplains. A more restrictive ordinance\n shall continue in full force and effect to the extent of the greater restrictions,\n but not otherwise.\n(b)\nThis ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing deed restrictions,\n covenants, or easements. If this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provisions\n of this ordinance shall prevail.\n(9)\nInterpretation\n.\nIn their interpretation and application, the provisions of this ordinance are the\n minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the City and are not a limitation\n on or repeal of any other powers granted by the Wisconsin Statutes. If a provision\n of this ordinance, required by ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code, is unclear, the provision\n shall be interpreted in light of the standards in effect on the date of the adoption\n of this ordinance or in effect on the date of the most recent text amendment to this\n ordinance.\n(10)\nWarning and Disclaimer of Liability\n.\nThe flood protection standards in this ordinance are based on engineering experience\n and research. Larger floods may occur, or the flood height may be increased by human\n made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply or guarantee that non-floodplain\n areas or permitted floodplain uses will be free from flooding and flood damages. This\n ordinance does not create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against,\n the City or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that may result from\n reliance on this ordinance.\n(11)\nSeverability\n.\nShould any portion of this ordinance be declared unconstitutional or invalid by a\n court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this ordinance shall not be affected.\n(12)\nAnnexed Areas for Cities and Villages\n.\nThe Dane County floodplain zoning provisions in effect on the date of annexation shall\n remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all annexed areas until\n the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which meets the requirements of\n ch. NR 116, Wis. Adm. Code and 44 CFR 59-72, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).\n These annexed lands are described on the City's Official Map. Dane County floodplain\n zoning provisions are incorporated by reference for the purpose of administering this\n section and are on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator. All plats or maps\n of annexation shall show the regional flood elevation and the floodway location.\n(Cr. by\nORD-25-00012\n, 3-20-25)\n\nThe City shall review all zoning certificate applications to determine whether proposed\n building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding and assure that all necessary\n permits have been received from those governmental agencies whose approval is required\n by federal or state law.\n(1)\nIf a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial\n improvements shall:.\n(a)\nBe designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the\n structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects\n of buoyancy;\n(b)\nBe constructed with flood-resistant materials;\n(c)\nBe constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages; and\n(d)\nMechanical and utility equipment must be elevated to or above the flood protection\n elevation.\n(2)\nIf a subdivision or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, the community\n shall assure that:\n(a)\nSuch proposed subdivision or other proposed new development is consistent with the\n need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area;\n(b)\nPublic utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems\n are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and\n(c)\nAdequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.\nAll subdivision proposals (including manufactured home parks) shall include regional\n flood elevation and floodway data for any development that meets the subdivision definition\n of this ordinance and all other requirements in subsection\n21.23\n(2).\n(Cr. by\nORD-25-00012\n, 3-20-25)\n\n(1)\nNo floodplain development shall:\n(a)\nObstruct flow, defined as development which blocks the conveyance of floodwaters by\n itself or with other development, causing any increase in the regional flood height;\n or\n(b)\nCause any increase in the regional flood height due to floodplain storage area lost.\n(2)\nThe Zoning Administrator shall deny zoning certificates",
